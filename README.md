# Fashion-Class-Classification
### Classification of fashion_mnist data with a simple Convolutional Neural Network(CNN)
The fashion_mnist dataset consists of 60,000 train and 10,000 test instances. The aim is to classify an image into one of 10 categories. The possible categories/labels are:


Label Description
- T-shirt/top
- Trouser
- Pullover
- Dress
- Coat
- Sandal
- Shirt
- Sneaker
- Bag

Each gray-scale input is a 28x28 low-resolution image
